This repository contains a set of tools designed to simplify folder and file management tasks. Below is a brief description of each tool:

## Tools Overview

### 1. Build-a-Folder
This tool allows the user to create multiple folders consecutively. It prompts the user for folder names and creates them until the user types **"done"** which exits the folder creation process.

### 2. FolderFolio
This tool lists all the folders and files in a specified folder destination provided by the user. It gives an overview of the folder contents for easy reference.

### 3. RenameRoulette
This tool renames all files and folders within a specified folder destination provided by the user to randomly generated numbers. Each file or folder gets a unique random number, replacing the original name, which can help with anonymizing or organizing files.

### 4. ShortcutExecutor I-O
This tool executes all shortcuts located in a user-specified folder. It begins by prompting the user to provide the folder location.

### 5. ShortcutExecutor
This tool automatically executes all the shortcuts stored in a specific folder location. It runs the shortcuts defined in the code without requiring any user input, making it ideal for repetitive or predefined tasks.
